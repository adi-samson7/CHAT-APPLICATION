NAME: Aditya Samson

INTERN ID: CT08DL961

DOMAIN: FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

BATCH DURATION: May 20th,2025 to July 20th, 2025

MENTOR NAME : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :

Task 2 involves building a browser-based real-time chat application named LiveChat, which allows users to create or join chat rooms and exchange messages instantly. 

This application simulates a multi-user environment where individuals can chat, monitor user presence, and interact through named chat rooms.

The primary focus of this task is to implement WebSocket-based communication using Socket.IO, coupled with modern vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a responsive and interactive user interface.

It covers the fundamentals of client-server communication, room-based message broadcasting, and real-time updates.

Core Features:

1. User Authentication by Username
   
The application begins with a simple input form where users are prompted to enter a username.

This username becomes their identity within chat rooms. While the authentication is non-persistent (no backend storage), it ensures uniqueness for user identification during the session.

2. Room Creation and Management:
   
Users can either:

1- Create a Room: A new room is generated by calling a backend endpoint (/create-room) which returns a unique Room ID. 
Users can assign a custom room name which is then associated with that ID using /register-room.

2- Join a Room: By entering an existing Room ID, users can fetch the corresponding room name (/room-name/:id) and enter the room.

Both operations are followed by an automatic transition to the chat interface once the room is validated and ready.

3. Real-Time Messaging:

The chat system is built on top of Socket.IO, providing:

Message Broadcasting: Messages sent by any user in a room are broadcast to all connected users in that room.

Differentiation of Messages:

Messages sent by the current user are displayed on the right (message-right)
Messages received from others appear on the left (message-left)
System messages (e.g., “User joined”) are styled separately (system-message)
All messages are appended to a message list in real-time and automatically scrolled to the latest one.

4. Online User Count and List:

The chat interface shows:

1- The number of users currently online in the room (Online: X)

2- A dynamic list of usernames currently in the room

These are updated in real-time as users join or leave.

5. Room Exit and App Navigation:

Users can:

1- Exit a room using the “Exit Room” button, which emits a leave-room event and returns them to the room selection screen.

2- Use the LiveChat logo (goHome) to reset the app and return to the login screen.

All UI state (messages, room info, user list) is cleared on exit to ensure a clean slate for each new session.

6. Dark/Light Mode Toggle:

A theme toggle button is provided at the top, allowing users to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode dynamically by toggling CSS classes.

Technical Overview:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)

Conclusion:

Task 2 demonstrates the core concepts of building a real-time collaborative chat application using web technologies.

It involves client-side socket handling, dynamic DOM updates, multi-screen navigation, and basic user presence tracking. 

This task not only strengthens practical understanding of WebSocket-based apps but also lays a foundation for more complex systems such as collaborative tools, multiplayer games, or group communication platforms.
